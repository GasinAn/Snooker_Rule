\subsection{违反体育精神的行为}\label{2241}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \label{2241a}在下列事件中：\\
    In the event of 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item 球员讲冒犯性的话语，或者做冒犯性的姿势；或者\\
        a player using offensive language, or making offensive gestures; or
        \item 球员的行为被裁判视为故意或者持续违反体育精神；或者\\
        any conduct by a player which in the opinion of the referee is wilfully or persistently Unsporting; or
        \item 球员有其它行为，其严重性累积到违背体育精神；或者\\
        any other conduct by a player which otherwise amounts to Unsporting Conduct; or
        \item 球员拒绝继续进行当局；\\
        any player refusing to continue the current frame;
    \end{enumerate}
    裁判应警告球员再有任何有违体育精神的事件本局会被判其对手赢得。\\
    the referee shall Warn the player that in the event of any further Unsporting Conduct the frame will be awarded to their opponent.
    \item \label{2241b}如果裁判已按上面\ref{2241a}警告过球员，那么在再有违背体育精神的行为的事件中，裁判员应该判对手赢得此局，如果事情发生在局间，则判对手赢得下一局，并且裁判应警告球员再有任何有违体育精神的事件本场会被判其对手赢得。\\
    If the referee has Warned the player under \ref{2241a} above, in the event of any further Unsporting Conduct, the referee shall award the frame to their opponent, or, if this happens between frames, the referee shall award the next frame to their opponent, and the referee shall Warn the player that in the event of any further Unsporting Conduct the game will be awarded to their opponent.
    \item \label{2241c}如果裁判已按上面\ref{2241b}或下面\ref{2241d}警告过球员，那么在再有违背体育精神的行为的事件中，裁判员应该判对手赢得此场。\\
    If a referee has awarded a frame to a player's opponent, under \ref{2241b} above or \ref{2241d} below, in the event of any further Unsporting Conduct by the player concerned, the referee shall award the game to the player's opponent.
    \item \label{2241d}在裁判员认为行为足够严重的事件中，裁判员应该判对手赢得此局或此场，即使之前没有就违背体育精神的行为做过警告。\\
    In the event that the conduct, in the opinion of the referee is sufficiently serious, the referee shall award the frame or the game to the player's opponent, even if previous Warnings for Unsporting Conduct were not issued.
    \item 裁判员做出的判一位球员的对手赢得一局和/或一场的决定都是最终的并且任何申诉都不能改变之。 \\
    Any decision by the referee to award a frame and/or game to a player's opponent shall be final and shall not be subject to any appeal.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{认输}\label{2242}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item 球员可以提出认输，但如果他们的对手选择继续比赛那么其无效。\\
    A player may offer a concession, but this becomes null and void if their opponent chooses to play on.
    \item 球员不应在任意场或次比赛中认输一局除非任意球员需要罚分(才能获
    胜)。违反本规则的违反应被视为相关球员的违背体育精神的行为。如果裁判已经按上面的规则\ref{2241}\ref{2241a}警告过球员，那么下一局应被判其对手赢得。\\
    A player shall not concede a frame in any game, or match unless any player requires penalty points. Any breach of this Rule shall be regarded as Unsporting Conduct by the player concerned. If the referee has already Warned the player under Rule \ref{2241}\ref{2241a} above, the next frame shall be awarded to their opponent.
    \item \label{2242c}如果一位球员碰触或移动一个或多个球以表明提出认输，那么如果认输被他们的对手接受那么裁判不会宣告``犯规''或``受罚''。如果认输不被接受，那么第\ref{223}节规则\ref{22316}或第\ref{223}节规则\ref{2233k}应适用。\\
    If a player touches or moves a ball(s) in play to indicate the offering of a concession, the referee will not call FOUL or PENALTY if the concession is accepted by their opponent. If the concession is not accepted, Section \ref{223} Rule \ref{22316} or Section \ref{223} Rule \ref{2233k} shall apply.
    \item 如果一位球员在需要罚分以赢得此局前故意发生违规从而结果他们现在需要罚分(以赢得此局)，那么此被视为违反体育精神的行为并且球员应被裁判依上面的规则\ref{2241}\ref{2241a}和\ref{2241}\ref{2241b}警告。\\
    If a player, prior to needing penalty points to win the frame, intentionally commits an infringement so that, as a result, they now require penalty points, it will be deemed as Unsporting Conduct and the player shall be Warned by the referee as in Rule \ref{2241}\ref{2241a} or \ref{2241}\ref{2241b} above.
    \item 认输的提出或接受不能被撤回。\\
    The offer, or the acceptance of a concession, cannot be withdrawn.
    \item 当累计得分决定一场或一次比赛的胜者并且一局被认输时，对手应得到等价于台面上剩余的球所有分数，此时红球每个按八分算入并且任何错误地离开台面的彩球均视为已摆上点位而算入。\\
    When aggregate scores determine the winner of a game or a match and a frame is conceded, the opponent shall receive the equivalent of the value of any balls remaining on the table, where Reds shall count as eight points each and any colour incorrectly off the table shall be counted as if spotted.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{浪费时间}\label{2243}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \label{2243a}如果球员在击球或者考虑击球的选择时用不正常量的时间，那么裁判应警告球员如果再次在场中浪费时间，那么本局会被判其对手获胜。\\
    In the event of a player taking an abnormal amount of time over a stroke, or the selection of a stroke, the referee shall Warn the player that in the event of any further Time Wasting during the game, the frame will be awarded to their opponent.
    \item \label{2243b}如果裁判已经按上面\ref{2243a}中所述针对球员浪费时间警告，那么如果此球员再浪费时间，那么裁判应判其对手赢得此局。\\
    If the referee has Warned the player for Time Wasting under \ref{2243a} above, in the event of any further Time Wasting by that player, the referee shall award the frame to their opponent.
    \item \label{2243c}如果果裁判已经就球员浪费时间判一局对手获胜，那么如果相关的球员再浪费时间，那么每再出现一次裁判都应判其对手赢得一局。\\
    If a referee has awarded a frame to a player's opponent for Time Wasting, in the event of any further Time Wasting by the player concerned, the referee shall, each time thereafter, award a frame to the player's opponent.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{处罚细则}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item 如果一局根据本节被判对手获胜，那么犯规者应：\\
    If a frame is forfeited under this Section, the offender shall:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item 输掉相关局；并且\\
        lose the relevant frame; and
        \item 当累计得分决定一场或一次比赛的胜者并且一局被认输时，对手应得到等价于台面上剩余的球所有分数，此时红球每个按八分算入并且任何错误地离开台面的彩球均视为已摆上点位而算入。\\
        when aggregate scores determine the winner of a game or match, forfeit all points scored and the opponent shall receive the equivalent of the value of any balls remaining on the table, where Reds shall count as eight points each and any colour incorrectly off the table shall be counted as if spotted.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item 如果一场根据本节被判对手获胜，那么犯规者应：\\
    If a game is forfeited under this Section, the offender shall:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item 输掉相关局；并且\\
        lose the relevant frame; and
        \item 附带地，当局分事关比赛胜负时尚未进行的事关这场比赛胜负
        的几局球都算对手获胜；或者\\
        additionally, lose the required number of unplayed frames to complete the game where frames are relevant; or
        \item 附带地，当用累计得分决定比赛胜负时，剩下的球局都算对手
        获胜并且每局球对手的得分按147计。\\
        additionally, lose the remaining frames, each valued at 147 points, where aggregate points determine the winner of the game.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{非击球手}

\noindent 当击球手正在比赛时，非击球手应避免站在或移动于击球手的视线(范围)内。他们应坐下，或是站在与球台有合理距离处并且避免任何影响击球手的注意力的移动或行为。\\
The non-striker shall, when the striker is playing, avoid standing or moving in the line of sight of the striker. They shall sit or stand at a reasonable distance from the table and avoid making any movement or action that may interrupt the concentration of the striker.

\subsection{计分的职责}

\noindent 同裁判一样，球员也有责任保证得分的正确，不管是记分牌上的还是裁判员报出来的。如果球员发现比分有错误，他们有责任尽早告诉裁判。\\
As well as the referee, it is the players' responsibility to make sure that the correct score is being applied, either on the scoreboard or by the referee announcing the scores. If any player notices that the score is incorrect, it is their responsibility to inform the referee at the earliest opportunity.

\subsection{离开场地}

\noindent 如果离开球桌，非击球手可以选定一名代表以照顾其利益并在需要的情况下指出对方的违规。这样的指定必须在离开前让裁判知晓。\\
In the case of their absence from the table, the non-striker may appoint a deputy to watch in their interest and claim an infringement if necessary. Such appointment must be made known to the referee prior to departure.
